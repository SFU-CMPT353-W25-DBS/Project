I wanted to make sure that I left you with an good example of a project that you can look back on. So here's a brief(ish) overview of the what I did behind the scenes which I didn't have time to explain fully during the project.

<br/>

# 1. VSCode & Jupyter
Did you know that you can run Jupyter notebooks directly in VSCode? Now you do! I had a few reasons why I pushed for us to do this. Apart from the fact that we all already had VSCode installed, Jupyter makes working with file trees sooo much simpler. Let me give you an example:

```python [script.py]
import pandas as pd
pd.read_csv("./dataset.csv")
```

When you run this script, where will Python look for `dataset.csv`{lang="csv"}? Rather inconveniently, it will look relative to the **current working directory (CWD)**. If your CWD is the exactly the same as the location of `script.py`{lang="python"}, then that's no problem. But if you have to run, say `python ./subdir/script.py`{lang="shell"}, then you'll probably run into issues. Now you have to remember to do one of two things:
1) Change your CWD to be where `script.py`{lang="python"} is with `cd`{lang="shell"}, or
2) Separate where you put `dataset.csv`{lang="csv"} and your script like so:
```
. (cwd/)
│   dataset.csv
│
└── subdir/
    │   script.py
```

Neither of the options are good; one is prone to forgetfulness, and the other is not clean. So how do we fix this?

## Jupyter Notebooks (for VSCode)
Apart from the niceties that Jupyter notebooks provide, such as inline outputs and text cells, one of the most useful features is how it handles working directories. When you run a Jupyter Notebook (in VSCode) the CWD is automatically set to be the location of the notebook for you! That means that **paths such as `./dataset.csv`{lang="csv"} are always relative to the location of the notebook**. This is a much easier rule to remember.

So that's the gist, Jupyter makes paths easier to work with. And because our project used a lot of paths (ex, our pipeline system), nice logic for that was effectively essential.

# 2. Collecting Outages

The code for collecting the outages is a bit complex, so I want to go over more details about it and tie it into a bit of a tutorial on Git as well.

First, some information. Python doesn't have a native way to interact with Git. Remember that Git is a piece of software like any other. What Python can do, however, is interact with the command line. These are called **subprocesses**. So, if you want to run a command line command using Python, you can **spawn** a subprocess. So that's what is going on here:

```python [1.acquire.ipynb]
result = subprocess.run(
  ["git", "clone", "https://github.com/outages/bchydro-outages.git", f"./{repoName}"],
  cwd=target,
  capture_output=True,
)
```

This simply translates to `git clone https://github.com/outages/bchydro-outages.git`{lang="shell"}, plus a little extra to control where the repository is cloned to.

The cool part is that, in Python, the script won't continue until after the subprocess has wrapped up. In other words, this is a **synchronous** operation, as opposed to an **asynchronous** operation where Python started the clone and just kept going without waiting for it to finish. So when Python proceeds to the next line, we can safely assume that the repository has been fully downloaded.

## Getting History

Each commit in the outages repo represents the outages that were ongoing at that point in time. We need a way to turn that into historical data. 

The first step is to reduce our dataset into something manageable. So once again, we'll be working with git. The `git log` command will be particularly useful. On its own, this command will show you information on every commit made from newest to oldest. If you run it though, you'll notice that it's rather verbose and not very machine readable:

```sh [git log output]
$ git log

```
  > *Type 'q' in the command line to quit the command*

<br/>

Fortunately for us, Git has a bunch of options that we can use to control the output to narrow down specifically what and how we see information. Here's what I used:

```shell
git log --before="2025-01-02" --since="2024-01-01" --pretty=format:%H:%ct --reverse 
```

1) `--before`: Only log commits before this date
2) `--since`: Only log commits after this date
    - Together, these options allow us to specify a date range of commits to return
3) `--pretty=format:%H:%ct`: This controls the format of the output through something called a **format string**. When Git encounters one of these strings, it will replace it with relevant information ([All available replacements](https://git-scm.com/docs/pretty-formats)).
    - `%H` -> The commit hash (a unique identifier for the commit)
    - `:` -> Not part of the format string, this colon will appear in the output as-is (I use it as a separator)
    - `%ct` -> The commit date (in UNIX time, i.e. seconds since January 1st, 1970)
4) `--reverse`: This reverse the order of the output, changing to oldest first. This will be useful to us later.

Here's a sample of what we get:
```sh [git log output]
$ git log --before="2025-01-02" --since="2024-01-01" --pretty=format:%H:%ct --reverse 

666719985046654a07de9f375424ff741c76bc03:1704163158
90f3058db900de8cdec78cdc8d703f8643bca356:1704163626
432a5b6c31a31705e150218cfc7cdcb28d38baa6:1704164904
fe8cc40d10aa32dfe535ba8938fb2ab24928b097:1704165758
cc13d5d616c2be0ac2c3f9bd8665cc1334cb5886:1704166366
...
```

A couple quick notes on these commands:

1. To get information specifically on the bchydro-outages repository, you need to make sure that your CWD is set to be in that directory. If you run these commands in, say, the root of our project directory, it will show you repo information for our project instead.

2. The way I get this data back into Python is via the `capture_output=True` option when I create the subprocess. This makes a little more sense if you done any work with Unix systems, but it effectively changes Python to be the "stdout" location of the command, instead of your command line. Learning more about "stdout" and "stderr" might be a good idea (look up "bash redirection"), but is beyond the scope of what I want to talk about.

## Reading the Commits
The next goal is to read each commit to get the active outages out of them.

You're probably be familiar with `git checkout` if you've ever had to switch branches in git. Put simply, it changes your current git environment (and hence, what files and revisions you see) to the state of a specific location (branch) or point in time (commit). So if you run `git checkout <commit>`{lang="shell"}, it will change your working directory to be the state of the repository at that commit. 

So with that in mind, here's the plan
1) For each commit: `git checkout someCommit`{lang="shell"}
2) Read the `bchydro-outages.json`{lang="json"} and save it somewhere
3) Parse it

To make things a little harder, remember that each commit only contains information on the active, ongoing outages. That means that we'll never know the specific time that an outage ended and we'll need to manually figure that out.

Fortunately, because we are working from oldest to newest commit, we can assume that if an outage has ended when we reach a commit that doesn't mention it anymore. That does mean that outages mentioned in the most recent commit aren't recorded, but that makes sense as they haven't ended yet.

Now, you're mostly caught up with how it all works. Of course, let me know if you have any other questions about this. Happy to elaborate wherever needed.
